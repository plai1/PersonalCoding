* Basic Data Types of C++:
  - 'int': integer numbers
  - 'double': floating-point numbers
  - 'char': individual characters
  - 'string': a sequence of characters
  - 'bool': true/false values

* declaring and initializing variables same as java

* to declare variable:
    std::cout << /variable/ << "\n";

    - notice how after variable is placed, another pair of '<<' is written and "\n" is declared later.


Chaining
  * when printing out different types of data with one 'std::cout':
      std::cout << /datatype1/ << /dataTyp2/ << "\n";

User Input
  * asking user to input something
  * example:
      std::cin >> tip;
      - 'cin' refers to "see-in" or (character input)
      - '>>' refers to ("Get from") to where that input goes
      - 'tip' defines variable input is set to (variable is declared first before use)
