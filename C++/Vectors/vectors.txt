Vectors
  * sequence of elements that can be accessed by index
  * must include '#include <vector>' to use vectors in program

Creating a Vector
  * syntax to create vector looks like:
     - 'std::vector<type> name;'
      + 'type' represents data type (int, bool, string)
      + 'name' is name of vector



Initializing a Vector
  * can create and initialize vectors with data
      - example:
        + 'std::vector<double> name = {42.651443, -73.749302};'
        + after initialization, bracket with two double values is typed
  * can create and initialize vectors with empty data
      - example:
        + 'std::vector<double> name(2)';
        + after 'name' parenthese with number creates vector with two empty values
          inside vector


Index
  * when getting specific element in vector, use vector name and straight bracket
    with number in it to call specific element and vector index.
  * example:
      std::vector<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
      std::cout << vowels[0] << "\n";
      // will print 'a'


Adding and Removing Elements:
  * function to add element to vector as last element in list:
     - '.push_back()'
     - value in parenthese is whatever is added
     - name of vector comes before function
  * function remove element:
    - '.pop_back()'
    - nothing in parenthese (probably)

.size()
  * reports size of vector
