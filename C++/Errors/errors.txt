Four types of Errors in C++:
  * Compile-Time Errors: Erros found by the compiler
  * Link-Time Errors: Errors found by the linker when it's trying to combine
    object files into an executable program
  * Run-Time Errors: Errors found by checks in a running program
  * Logic Errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the cause of erroneous results



Compile-Time Errors
  * Two types of comiple time errors:
      - Syntax errors: Errors that occur when we violate rules of C++ Syntax
      - Type Errors: Errors that occur when there are mismatch between types declared


Link-Time Errors
  * when compiling is fine but program need function or library it can't find
  * when dividing program into separate files and finally compiling them,
    linker takes those separate object files and combines them into single executable
    file
    - link-time errors found by linker when it's trying to combine object files into executable file
    - Example:
       + using function that was never defined
       + writing 'Main()' instead of 'main()'



  Run-time Errors
    * errors that happen during run-time after compiling
    * occur when program (after compile and link-time error is not found) asks computer
      to do something that is unable to reliably do
    * happens after using './' to execute file



  Logic Errors
    * errors where program doesn't do what coder want it to do or when no output is produced
    * depend on logical thinking of programmer
