Compile & Execute
  * When programming in C++, goes through 4 phases:
    - Code (writing the program)
    - Save (saving the program)
    - Compile (compiling via the terminal)
    - Execute (executing via the terminal)
  * to compile a file, type 'g++' in front of file name in terminal
  * compiler translate program and create machine code file called 'a.out'
  * to execute, type './' and machine code file ('a.out') in terminal to run it

Compile & Execute (Naming Executables)
  * sometimes when compiling, we want to name output executable file a specific name
  * to do this, after typing 'g++' and file name, type '-o' and a name for that file
  * the machine code file will then be the name that you typed in terminal after '-o'
  * example:
        g++ hello.cpp -o hello
        ./hello
