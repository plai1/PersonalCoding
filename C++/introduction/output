C++ introduction
  * example code:
      #include <iostream>           //include libraries//

      int main()    //The main() function
      {     //beginning of a function
          //What the program does//
      }   //end of function

  * print statement:
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
        - (std::cout) is '(c)haracter (out)put stream', pronounced "see-out"
        - (<<) is operator that comes right after
        - ("Hello World!\n") is what's outputted, "\n" indicates new line
        - (;) in punctuation that tells computer it is end of statement

  * the (#include <iostream>) is known as a pre-processor directive
    - instructs compiler to locate file containing code for library (iostream)
    - library contains code that allows for input and output (displaying data in terminal window, or reading input from keyboard)
