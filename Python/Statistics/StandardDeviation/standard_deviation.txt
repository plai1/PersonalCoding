Standard Deviation
  * variance is tricky statistic to use cause its units are different from both mean data itself
      - Example: mean of NBA dataset is 77.98 inches, so someone that is 80 inches tall is 2 inches taller
        than average NBA player
          + but because formula for variance includes squaring difference between data and mean, variance
            is measured in units squared
          + this means variance for NBA is 13.32 inches squared
          + hard to interpret in context with mean or data cause units are different
          + this is where statistic standard deviation useful
  * standard deviation computed by takign square root of variance
  * in python, square root of number can be found using '** 0.5'




Standard Deviation in NumPy
  * there is NumPy function dedicated to finding standard deviation of dataset
  * NumPy function 'std()' takes dataset as parameter and returns standard deviation of that dataset
​     - Example:
          import numpy as np

          dataset = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23 ,42]
          standard_deviation = np.std();




Using Standard Deviation
  * using matching units makes measure of spread easier to interpret
  * finding number of standard deviations a data point is away from mean, it is possible to begin investigating
    how unusual datapoint truly is
      - 68% of data fall within one standard deviation of mean
      - 95% of data fall within two standard deviations of mean
      - 99.7% of data fall within three standard deviations of mean
      - having data points over three standard deviations away from mean is very unusual
