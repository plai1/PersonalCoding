Variance
  * when two datasets have same mean and median, report would not show any meaningful difference
    between these two datasets
  * that is when variance comes into play
      - descriptive statistic that describes how spread out points in data set are




Distance from mean
  * to have variacne in data set of all sizes, find difference between each data with the data's mean
    to find the distance of a specific data from the mean



Average Distances
  * distances from mean shows how spread out the data is, but calculating variance depends on getting one number
    than describes entire dataset
  * to do this, we find the average of the differences from mean



Square the Differences
  * in datasets, there would be times where mean of a dataset is 0 (because of negative numbers)
  * when calculating variance, we don't care if data point was above or below mean, we only care about
    how far away it was
  * to deal with these negative numbers, square the difference between each data point and mean
      - difference = (mean - data)^2



Variance in NumPy
  * equation for variance starts by taking every point in dataset (point 1 to point n) and finding difference
    between that point and mean
  * next, square each difference to make all differences positive
  * finally, average those squared differences by adding them together and dividing by N (total number of points in dataset)
  * can be calculated quickly with Python's NumPy library.
      - 'var()' function does just that
