COUNT()
  * counts number of non-empty values of a selected column
  * Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name

SUM(column)
  * returns sum of all values in a selected column

MAX(column) / MIN(column)
  * returns data with highest/lowest value

AVG(column)
  * returns average number of integer data from column

ROUND(column, integer)
  * returns rounded value in column to number of decimal places specified by integer

GROUP BY /column/
  * clause used with aggregated functions
  * work with select arranging identical data to groups
  * goes after WHERE and before ORDER BY or LIMIT
  * when using GROUP BY or ORDER BY, can use numbers (1, 2) instead of name of column to save code time
    where numbers represent order of names selected after SELECT
      - Example: SELECT col1, col2, col3, FROM table
                    GROUP BY 1, 3, 2
                    # 1 = col1, 2 = col2, 3 = col3

HAVING
  * filter groups of specific criteria
  * WHERE only filters rows (which we don't want)
  * comes after 'GROUP BY' but before 'ORDER BY' and 'LIMIT'

WITH
  * statement allowing us to performs separate query (aggregating lists)
  *  WITH /temporaryTableName/ AS (
        SELECT ....
        ....
        ...
      )
      SELECT *
      FROM /anotherTable/
      JOIN /row element/
        ON /condition/
