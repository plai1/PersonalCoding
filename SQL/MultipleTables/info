JOIN /table/
  * joins two table together
  * select which table should be ordered in if they have the same data type
     - ON tabl1.rowtype1 = tabl2.rowtype2
        (this will joine tabl2 with table1 in order of how tabl1's rowtype1 is ordered in)
  * if row data doesn't contain same data in other row it is joining, JOIN only joins rows
    that match ON condition

LEFT JOIN
  * joins tow table together
  * like the above statement yet the unmatched elements on the will be kept on the first table

primary keys vs foreign keys
  * primary keys are keys in one table that defines a specific row
  * foreign keys are primary keys that are found in a different table.

CROSS JOIN
  * combines all rows of selected table and create possibilities with another table's data

UNION
  * stack one dataset on top of the other
  * when appending data:
      - tables must have same number of columns
      - columns must have same data type in same order as first table

WITH
  * combine two tables when one of them is result of another calculation
  * perform separate query
